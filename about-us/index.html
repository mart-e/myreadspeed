    <span><strong>Helping more, read more</strong><br/>
    People often wish they could do more reading. Not knowing it can be <em>easy once you get started</em> - so we thought we would help by showing just how easy.</span>
    
    <br/><br/>
    
    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>
    We created myReadSpeed to encourage more people to read by helping you see just how easy and quickly it is consume more books.
    </p>
    <p>
    By taking a <a href="/calculate/">quick and simple reading test</a>, 
    we instantly calculate and apply your personal reading speed to some classic novels and show you visually 
    - how long it should take to complete each book.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    You can then schedule any of the classic books to be sent in custom installments - to read by email - straight to your inbox. Absolutely free.
    </blockquote>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>
    A quick idea to help you read more books:
    </p>
    <p class="boxYellow">
    If you commute to work on weekdays, and want to read a classic novel, you can calculate the rate you read and then schedule 
    a personal installment to be sent to your email - for your commute.  
    <em>For example, sending a 30 minute installment each weekday, for your 30 minute train journey.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
    Or if you like a more leisurely read
    </p>
    <p class="boxYellow">    How about scheduling some personal time for yourself and sending a longer installment to read on the weekends?  Or as a way to unwind in the evening.
    </p>

    <h3>It's not a race</h3>
    <p>
    Calculating your personal reading speed is not a race.  
    The idea is to read at a comfortable and normal speed to determine your <strong>personal reading rate</strong> - to then see how easy it is to read more books.
    </p>

    <h3>...but if you like speed</h3>
    <p>
    We can help you consume more books.
    </p>
    <p>
    We also have some articles and tips if you are interested in learning how to improve your reading speed and how to develop reading comprehension.
